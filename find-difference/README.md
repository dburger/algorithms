# Find the Difference

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more
letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Hints

1. There are many ways to do this. An efficient way to do this is to use an
   integer array to track character counts. The oddball count is the guilty
   party.

## Solutions

### Character count array

Counting characters via an array is a common technique used in these problems.
Here we increment for characters in `s` and decrement for characters in `t`.
The character that ends up with a `-1` count is the added character.

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] characters = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            characters[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            characters[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
        }
        characters[t.charAt(t.length() - 1) - 'a']--;
        for (int i = 0; i < characters.length; i++) {
            if (characters[i] != 0) {
                return (char) ('a' + i);
            }
        }
        // For the compiler, cannot get here.
        return 'a';
    }
}
```
